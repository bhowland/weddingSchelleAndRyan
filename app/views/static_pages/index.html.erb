<h5>How They Met</h5>
<p>
	In 2012, Mischelle was interested in trying something new. She had been looking into martial arts or something like a LARP (Live Action Role Play). She talked to her sister Kelly about it and she “knew a guy” who was into gaming and who was involved in a LARP. Mischelle decided to give it a try. This is where Mischelle and Ryan met and soon they became good friends. 
</p>
<h5>The Proposal</h5>
<p>
	After Mischelle and Ryan had been dating for several years, they had their 3 year anniversary coming up in August of 2015. Hiking the trails in the area such as Devil’s Lake had become an important activity for Ryan and Mischelle. Before their weekend getaway in the Dells for their anniversary, they decided to hike to the waterfall at Parfray’s Glen near Merrimac, WI. What Mischelle didn’t realize, is that waiting at the waterfall were dozens and dozens of yellow flowers. While she was surprised, Ryan played music from a hidden speaker in his backpack and displayed cards with meaningful words on them at the waterfall until he knelt down and proposed to Mischelle. What a way to start a getaway weekend!
